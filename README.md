# Chirprush

Hello hello! I'm Rushil Surti, a senior at North Allegheny High School and
someone who's interested in basically all things $\textrm{Math} \cup
\textrm{Computer Science}$.

**Interests:**
I enjoy a lot regarding computer science, pure math, physics, and typography with LaTeX. Combinatorics, algebra, and number theory are probably my strong suits, but I enjoy a wide array of interests.

Currently studying:
- Signal processing
- Abstract linear algebra
- Differential geometry and tensor calculus
- Quantum Mechanics (see [this lecture series](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-04-quantum-physics-i-spring-2013/video_galleries/lecture-videos/))
- Contest math and programming
- Japanese

Cool things I should look into more:
- Electromagnetism
- Vector calculus
- More statistical models

**Setup:**
On my personal laptop, I run a setup of Ubuntu with i3 for my window manager (see my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/chirprush/chirpfiles) although I suppose I haven't updated them in a while). My main editor is neovim, although I sometimes use emacs for what it's worth.

**Languages:**
I'm sure everyone dabbles in a bunch on their own time, but my main languages are
- C++
- C
- Python
- Rust

There's also the whole web dev trio and other fun languages like Haskell or Prolog, but the above are usually what I reach for when working on something.
