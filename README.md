# Chirprush

Hello hello! I'm Rushil Surti, a junior at North Allegheny High School and
someone who's interested in basically all things $\textrm{Math} \cup
\textrm{Computer Science}$.

**Interests:**
I enjoy a lot regarding pure math, typography revolving around math with LaTeX, and math communication. Combinatorics and algebra are probably my strong suits, but I enjoy a wide array of interests.

Currently studying:
- Competition math
- Competitive programming
- Euclidean geometry (the American education system :pensive:)
- Group theory
- Linear algebra
- Enumerative combinatorics

Cool things I should look into more:
- Incidence combinatorics
- Graph theory
- Differential geometry for physics

**Setup:**
On my personal laptop, I run a setup of Ubuntu with i3 for my window manager (see my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/chirprush/chirpfiles) although I suppose I haven't updated them in a while). My main editor is neovim, although I sometimes use emacs for what it's worth.

**Languages:**
I'm sure everyone dabbles in a bunch on their own time, but my main languages are
- C++
- C
- Python
- Rust
There's also the whole web dev trio and other fun languages like Haskell or Prolog, but the above are usually what I reach for when working on something.
